_What do you want from me?_

_Why won't you run from me?_

_What are you wondering?_

_What do you know?_

_Why aren't you scared of me?_

_Why do you care for me?_

_When we all fall asleep,_

**_Where do we go?_**

#

Say it, spit it out

**What is it exactly?**

You're paying, is the amount-

-cleaning you out, am I satisfactory?

-

Today, I'm thinking about

The things that are deadly

-

The way I'm drinking you down

Like I wanna drown,

**_Like I wanna end me_**

#

_Step on the glass,_

_Staple your tongue..._

-

_Bury a friend,_

_Try to wake up..._

-

_Cannibal class,_

_Bury a son..._

-

_Bury a friend..._

**I wanna end me**
